# robot_sheep_herd
###Project Description
This repository was developed by Edoardo Barba it contains the code and documents for the final project of 
Distributed Robot Perception course of the Master in Artificial Intelligent Systems at the University of Trento, a.y. 2022-2023.

In this project, my primary objective is to use distributed algorithms and explore their application with a group of robots 
that behave like sheep in reaching a target. The collective behavior is inspired by the alternating leader-follower pattern observed 
in sheep, as elucidated in the paper "Intermittent collective motion in sheep results from alternating the role of leader and follower" by GÃ³mez-Nava, et al.
The report thoroughly explains how I approach this, detailing simulations and the experimental outcomes.

More details can be found in the project report.
